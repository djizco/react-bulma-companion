[Bulma Documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/delete/)

Supported Versions: `0.9.1`, `0.9.0`

## Default

The `Delete` component is a stand-alone element that can be used in different contexts.

On its own, it's a simple circle with a cross:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <Delete />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Sizes

It comes in 4 sizes by use of the `size` prop:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Sizes">
    <Delete size="small" />
    <Delete />
    <Delete size="medium" />
    <Delete size="large" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
