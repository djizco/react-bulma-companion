# Block

### Bulma's most basic spacer **block**

[Bulma Documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/block/)

Supported Versions: `0.9.2`, `0.9.1`, `0.9.0`

## Default

The `<Block>` component is a simple **spacer tool**. It allows **sibling** elements to have a consistent margin between them:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <React.Fragment>
      <Block>This text is within a <strong>block</strong>.</Block>
      <Block>This text is within a <strong>second block</strong>. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean efficitur sit amet massa fringilla egestas. Nullam condimentum luctus turpis.</Block>
      <Block>This text is within a <strong>third block</strong>. This block has no margin at the bottom.</Block>
    </React.Fragment>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

As you can see, the first two blocks have a `margin-bottom` applied, but **not the third one**. That is because Bulma applies a space on all blocks, **except the last one**. This means you can use as many blocks as you want, the spacing will only appear **between them**.
