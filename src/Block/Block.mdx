# Block

### Bulma's most basic spacer **block**

[Bulma Documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/block/)

## Default

The `<Block>` component is a simple **spacer tool**. It allows **sibling** elements to have a consistent margin between them:

<Canvas of={BlockStories.Basic} />

As you can see, the first two blocks have a `margin-bottom` applied, but **not the third one**. That is because Bulma applies a space on all blocks, **except the last one**. This means you can use as many blocks as you want, the spacing will only appear **between them**.

## Block Props

<ArgsTable of={Block} />
